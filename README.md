# Mark-Guesser-Text-Embeding-by-Universal-Sentence-Encoder-and-DNNRegressor

# [Playground]
This notebook is playground for text semantic extraction task and then guess the mark based on extracted semantic.
As input model have sentences with answer gived by person and as output model should guess the mark from 0 to 5 (continious) that evaluate that answer. For training data marks evaluated by experts.

Model using Text Embeding by Universal Sentence Encoder and DNNRegressor for matching embeds to marks.
